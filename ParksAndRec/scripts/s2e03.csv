1,Leslie Knope,"Good morning, everyone."2,Leslie Knope,A couple of announcements.3,Leslie Knope,"As we all know, Ron is recovering from his hernia surgery."4,Leslie Knope,So I got him flowers from all of us.5,Leslie Knope,"So everybody needs to pitch in, like, 90 dollars."6,April Ludgate,90 dollars?7,Leslie Knope,"Yes, because I ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils, from a website, after a few glasses of wine."8,Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, I think you might be getting some daffodils, too."9,Leslie Knope,"Donna, you're definitely getting some."10,Leslie Knope,Jerry?11,Leslie Knope,I don't know.12,Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.13,Leslie Knope,Time will tell.14,Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."15,Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."16,Tom Haverford,You get to be a judge in that thing?17,Leslie Knope,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously."18,Tom Haverford,But I want to be a judge.19,April Ludgate,I can't believe you like beauty pageants.20,Leslie Knope,"April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town."21,Leslie Knope,"And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise."22,Tom Haverford,Whoa.23,Tom Haverford,The girls from Talent and Poise gonna be there?24,Leslie Knope,What?25,Tom Haverford,Talent and Poise.26,Tom Haverford,It's the strip club by the VA hospital.27,Tom Haverford,I have some meetings there.28,Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.29,Tom Haverford,No.30,Tom Haverford,What's disgusting is the Glitter Factory.31,Tom Haverford,Do not go to the Glitter Factory.32,April Ludgate,Hey!33,Leslie Knope,Hey!34,April Ludgate,"So, I was just

Ludgate,You're welcome.39,April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."40,Leslie Knope,That's wonderful.41,Leslie Knope,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge."42,Leslie Knope,"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy."43,April Ludgate,Beauty pageants are idiotic.44,April Ludgate,But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets 600 dollars.45,April Ludgate,I can be idiotic for 600 dollars.46,April Ludgate,"So, are you gonna vote for me, sister?"47,Leslie Knope,"April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism."48,Leslie Knope,You and I are like family.49,April Ludgate,The coffee is 7 dollars.50,Leslie

Knope,How?62,Tom Haverford,I know a guy.63,Tom Haverford,I had to call in a few favors.64,Tom Haverford,"But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?"65,Leslie Knope,Hey.66,Dave Sanderson,Hey.67,Leslie Knope,Hey.68,Dave Sanderson,Hey.69,Leslie Knope,What you doing in these parts?70,Dave Sanderson,I just came by to see the murals.71,Dave Sanderson,This one's pretty amazing.72,Leslie Knope,"Yeah, this one's a beauty."73,Leslie Knope,"You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee."74,Leslie Knope,"This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven."75,Leslie Knope,"The original title of this was ""A Lively Fisting."""76,Leslie Knope,"But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons."77,Dave Sanderson,She's got him by the hair pretty good there.78,Leslie Knope,Yeah.79,Dave Sanderson,"Leslie's really cool, and she's smart."80,Dave Sanderson,It's a little intimidating.81,Dave Sanderson,"To tell you the truth, I didn't come here to look at the murals."82,Dave Sanderson,I came to ask her on a date.83,Dave Sanderson,"Hey, Leslie, I really like you."84,Dave Sanderson,"And I was wondering if maybe you'd want to get a cup of coffee or something, sometime."85,Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah, sure."86,Dave Sanderson,Yeah?87,Leslie Knope,Yeah.88,Leslie Knope,Absolutely.89,Leslie Knope,Let me check my schedule.90,Dave

Sanderson,"Cause I usually just call mine ""Nana."""97,Leslie Knope,"No, that's Madeleine Albright."98,Leslie Knope,The first female Secretary of State.99,Dave Sanderson,"Okay, so, not-- That's not your grandma, then."100,Dave Sanderson,All right.101,Dave Sanderson,I got it.102,Dave Sanderson,How's that schedule looking?103,Leslie Knope,"Good, a couple days are free."104,Leslie Knope,"Maybe we could just, you know"105,Dave Sanderson,Just lock it in later?106,Leslie Knope,Yeah.107,Dave Sanderson,Talk later about it?108,Leslie Knope,Yeah.109,Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.110,Dave Sanderson,Okay.111,Dave Sanderson,Ladies.112,Leslie Knope,You want to hear something awful?113,Leslie Knope,He didn't even know who Madeleine Albright was.114,Ann Perkins,Who?115,Leslie

Knope,That cop that I met.121,Leslie Knope,I don't know.122,Leslie Knope,I just don't know if I can date someone who doesn't share my interests.123,Leslie Knope,"I mean, could you date someone who doesn't love giving vaccinations?"124,Ann Perkins,I've never dated anyone who loves giving vaccinations.125,Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.126,Ann Perkins,Hey.127,Ann Perkins,Weird question for you.128,Ann Perkins,Are you handy?129,Ann Perkins,"Like, can you fix things?"130,Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, what's broken?"131,Ann Perkins,My shower.132,Ann Perkins,"It's leaky, low pressure, just all around terrible."133,Mark Brendanawicz,Easy.134,Mark Brendanawicz,You want me to come over after work?135,Ann Perkins,Yes.136,Ann Perkins,Yes.137,Ann Perkins,Amazing.138,Ann Perkins,"I will cook you a cheap, quick dinner that will be no trouble at all for me."139,Mark Brendanawicz,Great.140,Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'll see you tonight, for the weirdest second date ever."141,Ann Perkins,Okay.142,Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow judges."143,Leslie Knope,"I am Judge Leslie Knope and this is my colleague, Tom Haverford."144,Leslie Knope,He's also gonna be a judge.145,Jessica

weird, Andy."245,Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I have been trying really hard not to bother you."246,Andy Dwyer,"Like, when you had that barbecue last week, I didn't come up, even though it smelled so good."247,Ann Perkins,You've been here a whole week?248,Andy Dwyer,Yes.249,Andy Dwyer,One week only.250,Ann Perkins,"Oh, I guess I guess that's the office you were telling me about that you go to

Experiment."""273,Leslie Knope,What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?274,Trish Ianetta,"Well, uh, I think that America is the land of the free, which is a wonderful thing, and also the brave, where people can live, and no one can ever take that away from you and it never gives up."275,Trish Ianetta,But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.276,Trish Ianetta,"No offense to anyone out there, but if it were up to me and my family, I would actually call it ""Ourmerica,"" and not ""Theirmerica."""277,Trish Ianetta,Thank you.278,Leslie Knope,Don't applaud that.279,Leslie Knope,"No, she didn't-- She didn't answer my question."280,Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, you don't think it's weird that my exboyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house?"281,Mark Brendanawicz,It's not ideal.282,Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you should try to relax.283,Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe take one of those Ativans I saw in the medicine cabinet.284,Ann Perkins,Dude!285,Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I peeked."286,Mark Brendanawicz,I also didn't see any toothpaste.287,Mark Brendanawicz,Do you not use toothpaste?288,Ann Perkins,"I mean, I always knew he was lazy, but this is, like, a new low for him."289,Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like we should invite him inside.290,Mark Brendanawicz,Have you not been listening to anything I just said?291,Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?"292,Announcer,"Okay, folks, just a couple more contestants, and then the judges will decide our next Miss Pawnee, a winner of 600 dollars in gift certificates to Big Archie's Sporting Goods and Emerson Fencing Compa..."293,April Ludgate,What?294,April Ludgate,We don't get cash?295,April Ludgate,This is for a fence?296,Announcer,"Well, it won't cover a whole fence."297,Announcer,But it will defray the cost considerably!298,April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."299,April Ludgate,I quit.300,April Ludgate,I quit.301,Announcer,"Okay, I guess she really is quitting."302,April Ludgate,"No, I didn't win."303,April Ludgate,But at least I didn't make any new friendships.304,Tom Haverford,"So, how long do we have to pretend to deliberate until we go back out there?"305,Leslie Knope,What do you mean?306,Tom Haverford,We're all in agreement.307,Tom Haverford,"The hot one, by a landslide."308,Leslie Knope,"Well, her name is Trish."309,Leslie Knope,"And I don't think we should rush this, you know?"310,Jessica Wicks,What is there to talk about?311,Jessica Wicks,"I mean, I thought Trish was just adorable."312,Leslie Knope,"Well, take Susan, for example."313,Leslie Knope,I think--314,Tom Haverford,Susan Boring Stories?315,Tom Haverford,No.316,Tom Haverford,It's Trish.317,Tom Haverford,Let's go back out there.318,Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on, everyone."319,Leslie Knope,Hold on.320,Leslie Knope,"Everyone, wait, wait, wait."321,Leslie Knope,"Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year."322,Leslie Knope,She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.323,Leslie Knope,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it."324,Leslie Knope,Okay?325,Leslie Knope,Consider yourselves sequestered.326,Leslie Knope,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial."327,Leslie Knope,But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.328,Jessica Wicks,"Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past."329,Jessica Wicks,And I think Trish is a no-brainer.330,Leslie Knope,"Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?"331,Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I packed a suitcase."332,Ray Holstead,"I have to say, Leslie does make a good point."333,Ray Holstead,Trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.334,Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ray."335,Leslie Knope,"Good, I like what you're saying."336,Leslie Knope,Let's keep talking.337,Ann Perkins,Just stand over there and don't drip on anything.338,Andy Dwyer,"Is Mark the guy who's ""fixing your shower""?"339,Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about you, Mark, but I've seen a ton of porn."340,Andy Dwyer,"And I know what ""fixing your shower"" means."341,Ann Perkins,Andy‰€_342,Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, you guys are on a date."343,Andy Dwyer,That's cool.344,Ann Perkins,Andy?345,Andy Dwyer,"No, it's all right."346,Andy Dwyer,Don't let me interrupt your date.347,Ann Perkins,Keep eating.348,Andy Dwyer,I already ate.349,Andy Dwyer,I'm super full.350,Andy Dwyer,I don't I don't want any.351,Leslie Knope,"Okay, so, it's still 3- 2 for Trish."352,Leslie Knope,"Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?"""353,Announcer,It's the hot one.354,Announcer,Trish lanetta!355,Mark Brendanawicz,These are amazing.356,Mark Brendanawicz,Do you...
