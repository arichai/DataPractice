Can't you read that children's book on your own time?503,Leslie Knope,"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but"""504,Kate Spivack,"Okay, all right."505,Kate Spivack,"You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think."506,Leslie Knope,"Well, you did already talk, ma'am."507,Leslie Knope,And I would love to listen to someone else.508,Leslie Knope,Someone I don't know.509,Leslie Knope,Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.510,Leslie Knope,Could you tell us how you feel about this park?
